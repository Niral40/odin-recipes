    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Cheng teng or tong sui is just a general term for any Chinese-style soupy dessert that is clear in appearance without any cream. Cheng teng contains both cooling and heaty ingredients. Cheng teng can be a “cooling” dessert in hot weather, but it can also be a “warming” dessert during the colder months.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Snow fungus</li>
        <li>Malva nuts</li>
        <li>Peach gum</li>
        <li>Lotus seeds</li>
        <li>Barley</li>
        <li>Red dates</li>
        <li>Dried longan</li>
        <li>Ginkgo nuts</li>
        <li>Rock sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak snow fungus and lotus seeds in warm water until they are soft. Soak malva nuts in boiling water for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crack the lotus seeds open and remove the center green pits. They are bitter.</li>
        <li>Trim off the yellowish tough core of snow fungus and cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Pour 10 cups of water into the inner pot. Press saute mode and bring it to a boil. Add barley and tapioca pearls. Turn off saute mode. Close the lid and turn the steam release valve to “sealing”. Press “pressure cooker” and make sure it’s on high pressure and set the timer to 15 minutes and then do a natural release.</li>
        <li> Carefully unlock the lid. The tapioca pearls may still have some cloudiness in the center but as long as they are soft and chewy without the hard center, they are done. Turn the saute mode back on. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the malva nuts. Let them simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off saute mode and add pang da hai and stir to mix. Have a taste and add more sugar if needed.</li>
    </ol>
